Tutorial 2. Incompressible Navier-Stokes equations
In Lecture Notes   1 the Navier-Stokes equations (momentum balance) for incompressible flow   were derived. They were eventually written in the following form.

In this equation, the viscosity μ and the density ρ are constants. We now consider two simple   flow configurations.
Config. 1. The steady state flow of   a liquid   in   the   space between   two   very   large   static parallel   plates   at   distance H of   each   other   in   the   presence   of   a   constant   pressure   gradient   in   the x-direction  Gravity is pointing in the negative y-direction.
Config. 2. The start-up of   the flow of   liquid between two very large parallel plates   at   distance H of   each other. There is no pressure gradient. Before time t=0   everything is   standing   still.   At t=0, the upper plate starts 代 写EG501V Computational Fluid Dynamics (AY 2023/24)  Tutorial 2Matlab

Your assignments 
For Configuration   1:
a.    Begin with the full, two-dimensional Navier-Stokes equations and determine which of   the terms are zero and   which   are   not.b.   Derive   an   expression   for   the   velocity ux as   a   function   of y by   applying   the   simplified   NS    equations (as found under Item a.) and by applying the no-slip   condition   at   the two plates.
For Configuration 2:
c.    Begin with the full, two-dimensional Navier-Stokes equations and determine which of   the terms are zero and   which   are   not.
d.   Make   sure   that   when   steady   state   has   been   reached   ( t →   ∞   ), the   simplified   form   of   theNS equations as found under Item c. leads to   a linear   velocity profile between the plates.
